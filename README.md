# Supervised Image Classification Algorithm Using Representative Spatial Texture Features

This MATLAB code is useful to reproduce results of the paper "Supervised Image Classification Algorithm Using Representative Spatial Texture Features: Application
to COVID-19 Diagnosis Using CT Images" submitted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research. An medrxiv version of the paper can be found in https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243493v1.full.pdf

To run the code properly, please make sure that you install MATLAB or have access to the online version.

* The codes available in the folder "GLCM and Wasserstein distance compute" can be used for any set of images that you would analyse using the proposed texture feature approach. 
* The codes available in the folder "Classification pipeline" runs the proposed texture classification pipepline using the GLCM texture and Wasserstein distance matrix data that are available in the folder "Data". Excute the script "Main_run.m" to run the algorithm.
